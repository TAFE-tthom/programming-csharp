# Generic Swap

As another introduction to writing generic algorithms, you will write
a method that will swap the contents of two arrays. 

You will need to construct a `Swap` static method that will
allow all any kind of pair of arrays of the same time to be
used for swapping.

```
public static void Swap<T>(T[] arrayA, T[] arrayB)
```

## How to test

You can test your implementation against your set of
test cases using `dotnet test`.
