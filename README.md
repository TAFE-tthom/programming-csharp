# Programming - C#

The repository is a set of programming challenges and homework tasks aimed for students learning to program and want to have quick feedback to their solutions.


## Interaction - Task Setup

They have been broken up in a weekly basis, each week contains between 3-5 questions relevant to the topics introduced.

When solving these problems, the student is asked to complete the program and run it against the `*.Test` associated project.

This will attempt to validate if the solution given by the student has been solved.

## State

The project is still a work in progress, some of the solution may still have missing references that need to be resolved and I will perform a sweep on them all when I have some time to work on them.

## TermControl

The library `TermControl` is part of this project as it allows for interaction with standard input, output and error as well as constructing IO tests around them.

I will be extending this project to construct unit test cases based on IO (.in, .out) pairs in the near future to transition IO test cases into unit tests for the sake of uniformity of testing.
